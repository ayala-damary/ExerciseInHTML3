        A social experiment conducted in Israel recently showed Israelis unanimously helping a man who was posing as blind and appearing to have mistaken a large shekel bill for a small one.
        A video of the experiment shows the man posing as a blind student asking strangers to break a 20-shekel bill, which was actually a 100 shekel note. In the footage, every single person he stopped on the street — including some who approached to ask if he needed help — pointed out that the bill he was holding was, in fact, a 100 shekel bill. One man even gave him an additional 20 shekels to help him out.

    <p style="font: bold 16px 'Franklin Gothic Medium' verdana ">Other passersby behaved in exactly the same way when the same experiment was conducted with a 200-shekel bill.</p>
    <p style="font: bold 18px 'Arial Narrow' verdana">The same social experiment was previously carried out in Australia, where an actor pretended to be blind and asked strangers to break a $5 bill, which was actually $100. Unlike in Israeli, many in Australia took advantage of the situation. Some even took the blind man's money and ran off with it.</p>
    <p style="font: bold 20px sans-serif verdana">Although some of the researchers concluded that this experiment reflects the honesty of Israelis, others concluded that it reflects the concern and  care Israelis have for each other and does not necessarily mean that Israelis are honest.  </p>
